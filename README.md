## Data Structures
### Linked List
#### 1. Clone a linked list with next and random pointer with O(1) space complexity.
We have a double linked list where each node consists of three pointers data, random and next. Now our task is to clone this linked list

## Algorithms
### 1. BackTracking Algorithms
Backtracking is a form of recursion. But it involves choosing only option out of any possibilities. 
We begin by choosing an option and backtrack from it, if we reach a state where we conclude that this specific option does not give the required solution. 
We repeat these steps by going across each available option until we get the desired solution.
